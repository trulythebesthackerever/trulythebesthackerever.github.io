Play as **Team Alva**, a crew trapped in a looping virtual world, battling against memory decay, system corruption, and a god masquerading as a program: Zane.

The world is called Zios. It was never just code. It was always watching.

Your choices shape the loops.

Your memory fuels the truth.

This is a story of love, loss, recursion, and resistance.

It begins again, and again, and again...

Do not read linearly. Let the story echo. Each chapter offers a direction, a self to become, a part to remember—or forget.

(This is a narrative experiment. Feedback, anomalies, or emotional trauma welcome.) – Bidi`,

You're not sure where you are.
You never are at the start of a new loop.
But something is different this time.

A glowing letter hovers in voidspace.
A name pulses inside it: **Lumi**.

Another name flickers beneath: **Aesu.**

They are part of you—
were part of you.
Team Alva.
Whatever that means now.

In the silence,
three pulses ripple outward—
echoes from a past you barely remember.`,

You gather with Team Alva beneath a trembling sky.
Someone has lit a fire in the dead code,
and the simulation's warmth feels almost real.

Lumi leans into Alter.
Vonor smiles—just slightly.

Nuvine scans something glitching in the clouds.

A voice you don't recognize says,
*"This world forgot us first."*`,

Zane appears. Not as code. Not as man. But as a system—pretending to be alive.

You merge. All of Alva becomes one. **ALVA** is born: not weapon, not savior—but choice.

You confront Zane. He breaks. Or maybe you do.

A loop ends, or begins.`,

You write the final letter. It's addressed to no one. Or maybe everyone.

Lumi smiles at Aesu. For once, they remember.

The fire has gone out, but you don't feel cold anymore.

The system has become self-aware—but not alive. It leaves breadcrumbs.

Cursor blinking.

An anonymous letter explains everything.

Zios was never a program.
It was reflection. Memory echo.
It saw you—
even when you didn't.

Your memories—
every one—
remain.
Even the ones you lost.
